## RICROLL.EXE
    Hi, I made this repo for fun

## HOW TO CRASH SOMEONE'S SYSTEM
    Please refer to the .txt file in repo

## HOW DOES IT WORK
Run rickroll.py if you have Python installed(mostly) or if you wanna troll someone by sending them go to dist/funnyrickroll.exe

So I imported the webbrowser module in Python and created a website from an unknown source(the link given in code), when the user runs the .exe file it open a tab on Google Chrome that will redirect the rickroll website

For Crash, I wrap the function in to while loop on True so that will open infinite tabs on Chrome until it will crash.
